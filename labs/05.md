# Outcomes

This lab will quickly get you started on Leaflet basics for web map applications including:

1) setting up a Leaflet map
2) working with markers, polylines and popups
3) dealing with events

# What is Leaflet?

Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 42 KB of JS, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.

# In-class Practice

### Preparing your page

Before writing any code for the map, you need to do the following preparation steps on your page:

- Create a new html file with basic components

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>add a title</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

- Include Leaflet CSS file in the head section of your document:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css"
   integrity="sha256-p4NxAoJBhIIN+hmNHrzRCf9tD/miZyoHS5obTRR9BMY="
   crossorigin=""/>
```

- Include Leaflet JavaScript file after Leaflet's CSS:

```html
<!-- Make sure you put this AFTER Leaflet's CSS -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js"
   integrity="sha256-20nQCchB9co0qIjJZRGuk2/Z9VM+kNiyxNV1lvTlZBo="
   crossorigin=""></script>
```

- Put a div element with a certain id where you want your map to be:

```html
<div id="map"></div>
```

- Make sure the map container has a defined height, for example by setting it in CSS:

```html
#map { height: 400px; }
```

### Setting up the map

Let's create a map of the center of London with OpenStreetMap tiles. First we'll initialize the map and set its view to our chosen geographical coordinates and a zoom level:

```javascript
var map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);
```

Next we'll add a tile layer to add to our map. In this case we'll use the standard OpenStreetMap tiles:

```javascript
L.tileLayer('https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    maxZoom: 19,
    attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>'
}).addTo(map);
```

### Markers, circles and polygon

Besides tile layers, you can easily add other things to your map, including markers, polylines, polygons, circles, and popups. Let's add a marker:

```javascript
var marker = L.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(map);
```

Adding a circle is the same (except for specifying the radius in meters as a second argument), but lets you control how it looks by passing options as the last argument when creating the object:

```javascript
var circle = L.circle([51.508, -0.11], {
    color: 'red',
    fillColor: '#f03',
    fillOpacity: 0.5,
    radius: 500
}).addTo(map);
```

Adding a polygon is as easy:

```javascript
var polygon = L.polygon([
    [51.509, -0.08],
    [51.503, -0.06],
    [51.51, -0.047]
]).addTo(map);
```

### Working with popups

Popups are usually used when you want to attach some information to a particular object on a map. Leaflet has a very handy shortcut for this:

```javascript
marker.bindPopup("<b>Hello world!</b><br>I am a popup.").openPopup();
circle.bindPopup("I am a circle.");
polygon.bindPopup("I am a polygon.");
```

### Dealing with events

Every time something happens in Leaflet, e.g. user clicks on a marker or map zoom changes, the corresponding object sends an event which you can subscribe to with a function. It allows you to react to user interaction:

```javascript
function onMapClick(e) {
    alert("You clicked the map at " + e.latlng);
}

map.on('click', onMapClick);
```

### Geolocation

Leaflet has a very handy shortcut for zooming the map view to the detected location â€” locate method with the setView option, replacing the usual setView method in the code:

```javascript
map.locate({setView: true, maxZoom: 16});
```

You can also handle the response to the location detection with events:

```javascript
function onLocationFound(e) {
    var radius = e.accuracy / 2;

    L.marker(e.latlng).addTo(map)
        .bindPopup("You are within " + radius + " meters from this point").openPopup();

    L.circle(e.latlng, radius).addTo(map);
}

function onLocationError(e) {
    alert(e.message);
}

map.on('locationfound', onLocationFound);
map.on('locationerror', onLocationError);
```

# **Tasks:**

1. Complete the first three online Leaflet tutorials - create working HTML pages in your repo for each of the tutorials

- [Tutorial 1: Leaflet Quick Start Guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/)
- [Tutorial 2: Leaflet on Mobile](https://leafletjs.com/examples/mobile/)
- [Tutorial 3: Markers With Custom Icons](https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/)

2. Build a custom web map that integrates each of the tutorials

- give your webpage a title e.g. "Yourname First Web Map"
- zoom the map view to the detected location using *locate* method
- draw a circle around the **Kyle Field** (coordinates: [30.6084, -96.3402]) with a popup
- create custom icons with popups for **O&M Building** (coordinates: [30.6179, -96.3386]) and **Academic Building** (coordinates: [30.6159, -96.3413])
- create an event which enables you to see the coordinates in a popup when you click on the map

# **To Hand In:**

# Example Code for Custom Web Map

Here's a starter template you can use for your custom web map. You'll need to modify it to complete all the requirements:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your Name's First Web Map</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css"
     integrity="sha256-p4NxAoJBhIIN+hmNHrzRCf9tD/miZyoHS5obTRR9BMY="
     crossorigin=""/>
    
    <style>
        html, body {
            height: 100%;
            margin: 0;
        }
        #map {
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="map"></div>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js"
     integrity="sha256-20nQCchB9co0qIjJZRGuk2/Z9VM+kNiyxNV1lvTlZBo="
     crossorigin=""></script>
    <script>
        // Initialize the map
        var map = L.map('map').fitWorld();
        
        // Add OpenStreetMap tiles
        L.tileLayer('https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
            maxZoom: 19,
            attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>'
        }).addTo(map);
        
        // TAMU landmarks coordinates
        var kyleField = [30.6084, -96.3402];
        var omBuilding = [30.6179, -96.3386];
        var academicBuilding = [30.6159, -96.3413];
        
        // Try to locate the user
        map.locate({setView: true, maxZoom: 16});
        
        // Location found event handler
        function onLocationFound(e) {
            var radius = e.accuracy / 2;
            L.marker(e.latlng).addTo(map)
                .bindPopup("You are within " + radius + " meters from this point").openPopup();
            L.circle(e.latlng, radius).addTo(map);
        }
        
        // Location error event handler
        function onLocationError(e) {
            // If geolocation fails, center on Kyle Field
            map.setView(kyleField, 15);
            alert("Location access was denied or unavailable. Map centered on Kyle Field.");
        }
        
        // TODO: Create a circle around Kyle Field with popup
        
        // TODO: Create custom icons for O&M and Academic Building
        
        // TODO: Create click event to show coordinates in popup
        
        // Register event handlers
        map.on('locationfound', onLocationFound);
        map.on('locationerror', onLocationError);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Helpful Tips

- For custom icons, you'll need to define an icon using L.icon() and then use that icon when creating your markers
- To create a popup that shows coordinates when clicking on the map, use the map.on('click', function) event handler
- Make sure to test your geolocation in a secure context (HTTPS) as many browsers restrict geolocation API in insecure contexts
