# What is ArcGIS StoryMap?

Esri Story Maps are web applications that let authors combine beautiful maps with narrative text, striking images, and multimedia, including video. They make it easy to harness the power of maps and geography to tell your story. The applications are designed to be attractive and usable by anyone, which makes them great for education and outreach, either to the general public or to a specific audience. It is a simple yet powerful way to inform, engage, and inspire people with any story you want to tell that involves maps, places, locations, or geography.

# Your Task: Create a 3D Campus StoryMap

In this lab, you will create one StoryMap that showcases the TAMU campus using 3D visualization. You'll combine narrative text, images, and interactive 3D maps to tell a compelling story about an aspect of campus that interests you.

## Step 1: Define a theme for your StoryMap

Before developing your StoryMap, think about what aspect of the TAMU campus you want to focus on. Some ideas include:

- Campus architecture and landmarks
- Historical development of campus
- Navigation and wayfinding
- Green spaces and landscape features
- Academic districts or specialized facilities
- Student life and gathering spaces

## Step 2: Gather your content

1. Find photos of TAMU campus locations you'd like to feature, ensure attribution to photographer is present
2. Plan your narrative text to guide viewers through your story
3. Identify where in the 3D layer will best showcase your theme 

## Step 3: Access TAMU 3D Data

The TAMU 3D data layers are available through the university's ArcGIS Online platform. Here are the direct links:

1. **TAMU 3D buildings layer**: [https://tamu.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c375d0cbe6b246fb93fe93d378734fe4](https://tamu.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c375d0cbe6b246fb93fe93d378734fe4)

2. **TAMU street layer**: [https://tamu.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cdb47ce652a3466fa400093c60948bd1](https://tamu.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cdb47ce652a3466fa400093c60948bd1)

3. **TAMU parking lots**: [https://tamu.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=22fa00325613411081c8f1706e17c6cc](https://tamu.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=22fa00325613411081c8f1706e17c6cc)

4. **TAMU sidewalks**: [https://tamu.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=fbded2710f0f4a41bf8e06c6d41f1ce3](https://tamu.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=fbded2710f0f4a41bf8e06c6d41f1ce3)
